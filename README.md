# Recommendation System

This is a Python-based Recommendation System implemented on Google Colab, specifically designed for generating personalized movie recommendations, similar to those used by platforms like Netflix.

## Description

The project is centered around creating a recommendation system that provides users with movie recommendations tailored to their preferences and viewing history. Leveraging a variety of recommendation algorithms, including collaborative filtering and matrix factorization, this system analyzes user behavior and movie attributes to offer highly accurate and engaging movie suggestions.

The primary goal of this recommendation system is to enhance the user experience by helping individuals discover new movies they might enjoy, ultimately increasing user engagement and satisfaction on a movie streaming platform.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, simply open the `Recommendation_System.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.

## Usage

Follow the instructions in the notebook to run and customize the recommendation system for your own dataset or use case. You can experiment with different algorithms and parameters to fine-tune the recommendations.
